# WebXR Skipping Stones

An app that lets you play the game of skip stones on a cartoony water surface in your living room.

The objective of "skipping" is to see how many times a stone can bounce before it sinks into the water.

Here is a nice 2d version of the simulation:

Esc Key to interrupt current run. Mouse down drag to configure the stonefor run

## TODOs:
### Things still missing or bad: 
* Fix the physic/simulation code currently using a dummy

* 3d ui is difficult to use, maybe add a slider

* 2d ui needs some design

* Add sound effects and feedback when stone touches water

* Code cleanup and tests

### Later
* I want to use the phoneâ€™s gyro sensor movement to determine start angle and maybe velocity

* An AR version were you can use a real water surface

* Add more input parameters to the simulation: velocity, spin and stone weight


## Credits:
* 3d assets from https://poly.pizza

* Python code from
https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/B06902117/folder/Public/program/FinalProject
was used as a starting point for simulation

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository (you can also click "Use this template")
git clone https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate.git your_project_name
cd your_project_name

# Edit `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` to your liking
...

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Now you can run various yarn commands:
yarn cli
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn build
...
```

* Take a look at all the scripts in [`package.json`](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json)
* For publishing to npm, use `yarn publish` (or `npm publish`)

## esbuild

[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is an extremely fast bundler that supports a [large part of the TypeScript syntax](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript). This project uses it to bundle for browsers (and Node.js if you want).

```bash
# Build for browsers
yarn esbuild-browser:dev
yarn esbuild-browser:watch

# Build the cli for node
yarn esbuild-node:dev
yarn esbuild-node:watch
```

You can generate a full clean build with `yarn build-all` (which uses both `tsc` and `esbuild`).

* `package.json` includes `scripts` for various esbuild commands: [see here](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json#L23)
* `esbuild` has a `--global-name=xyz` flag, to store the exports from the entry point in a global variable. See also the [esbuild "Global name" docs](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#global-name).
* Read more about the esbuild setup [here](https://www.metachris.com/2021/04/starting-a-typescript-project-in-2021/#esbuild).
* esbuild for the browser uses the IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression) format, which executes the bundled code on load (see also https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/29)


## Tests with Jest

You can write [Jest tests](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) [like this](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/src/main.test.ts):

```typescript
import { greet } from './main'

test('the data is peanut butter', () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1)
});

test('greeting', () => {
  expect(greet('Foo')).toBe('Hello Foo')
});
```

Run the tests with `yarn test`, no separate compile step is necessary.

* See also the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
* The tests can be automatically run in CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI): [`.github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml`](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml), [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
* Take a look at other modern test runners such as [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) and [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)

## Documentation, published with CI

You can auto-generate API documentation from the TyoeScript source files using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/). The generated documentation can be published to GitHub / GitLab pages through the CI.

Generate the documentation, using `src/main.ts` as entrypoint (configured in package.json):

```bash
yarn docs
```

The resulting HTML is saved in `docs/`.

You can publish the documentation through CI:
* [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/): See [`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml)
* [GitLab pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/): [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://github.com/metachris/typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
